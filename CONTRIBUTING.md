### Forking the Repository

To contribute, you first need to create a fork of the repository. This means you’ll have your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account. To do this:

1. Navigate to the GitHub page of the project you wish to contribute to.
2. At the top-right corner of the page, click the “Fork” button.

### Cloning Your Fork

Once you have forked the repository, you need to clone it to your local machine to make changes. Here's how:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click the “Code” button and copy the URL shown.
3. Open your terminal and run `git clone [URL you copied]`. This will create a local copy of the fork.

### Making Your Changes

With the project cloned to your local machine, you’re ready to make your changes. Remember to:

1. Navigate to the project directory on your local machine.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
3. Make your changes in the code or documentation as needed.

### Pushing Your Changes

After you’ve made your changes, you need to commit and push them to your fork on GitHub as you would with any project

### Submitting a Pull Request

Finally, to merge your changes into the original repository, you need to submit a pull request:

1. On GitHub, navigate to your fork and click the “Pull request” button.
2. Choose the original repository as the base and your branch as the compare.
3. Click “Create pull request.”
4. Fill in a title and description for your pull request to explain your changes and click “Create pull request” again.

That’s it! Your contributions are now awaiting review. The project maintainers will review your work, suggest changes if necessary, and merge it into their project if everything looks good.

Thank you for contributing!
